# Project Title: Loan Interest Calculation and Testing
Course: CS341 - Software Quality Assurance and Testing
Author: [Akshat Newal. Mohammed Kamal, Group 9]

# 1. Project Description
This project involves the development and testing of a loan interest calculation program. The assignment covers the following tasks:

- Implementing the computeLoanInterest method for home and property loans.
- Creating test cases using Equivalence Partitioning (EP), Boundary Value Analysis (BVA), and Logical Coverage techniques.
- Automated testing using the JUnit framework.
  
# 2. Files in Submission
- CalcInterest.java: Java program that implements the loan interest calculation.
- CalcInterestTest.java: JUnit test cases for automated testing of the loan calculation.
- Assignment_1_Report.pdf: Report containing test cases and results for Question 1 and 2.
- Unit_Test_Plan.xlsx: Excel workbook for manually executed test cases.
- Defect_Tracker.xlsx: Excel workbook for tracking defects during testing.
- This ReadMe file: Instructions for running the project and additional information.

# 3. How to Run the Program
  Prerequisites:

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed (version 8 or later).
- A Java IDE like NetBeans 
- JUnit 5 for running the automated tests.

# Steps to Run:
- Download the assignment 1 file
- Open the Java project in your preferred IDE.
- Browse to CalcInterest.java, it should be at "assignment 1/app/src/main/java/assignment1"
- Compile and run the CalcInterest.java file to test the loan interest calculation manually.
- Alternatively, you can execute the CalcInterestTest.java file to run the automated JUnit tests which is located at "assignment 1/app/src/test/java/assignment1"

# Running JUnit Tests:

- Ensure that JUnit is properly configured in your IDE.
- Run the CalcInterestTest.java file, which will execute all predefined test cases.
- Check the console or test results window for passed/failed results.

# 4. Defects and Resolutions
- Defects discovered during manual and automated testing are logged in the Defect_Tracker.xlsx file.
- Each defect includes a description, severity, and action taken to resolve the issue.
